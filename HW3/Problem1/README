Goal: This project provides the main function that reads a text file and computes the relative frequency of each of the letters of the
alphabet.
The code can be built using the following steps in the terminal:
    ant dist
    cd dist
    java -jar Frequency.jar path-of-file

For the third command, you can try: java -jar Frequency.jar ../src/words.txt
Then it will ask for a filename of a text file. So enter(words.txt already is the test file):
    ../src/words.txt
