# Problem1

## Introduction
This a simple class which sorts the movies on the basis of title, year and score. The Main file consists of the sample test. The comparator class is overloaded so as to ease the process of comparison and sorting.

## Deployment

**Apache Ant**

An ant build.xml file is provided for building and running. 

**Compilation & Run**

In root directory, just execute

```
$ ant
```

to compile and run JAR files, with javadoc generated.



Or you can also use target names to execute separately:

```
$ ant init compile
$ ant javadocs
$ ant copy
$ ant runUseBook
$ ant runBookArray
$ ant clean
```
